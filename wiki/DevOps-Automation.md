# Automation in DevOps: Fix Before You Automate

Automation has become a cornerstone of modern DevOps practices, delivering unmatched efficiency, reliability, and speed. However, a critical principle often emphasized in successful DevOps implementations is: **"Automate healthy processes. If the underlying process is broken, fix it before automating it."** This principle ensures that automation truly enhances workflows rather than amplifying existing problems. Here’s a deep dive into why this approach is essential and how to implement it effectively.

## The Role of Automation in DevOps

Automation in DevOps streamlines repetitive tasks, ensures consistency, and accelerates delivery cycles. Key areas where automation shines include:

- **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Automating build, test, and deployment processes reduces manual effort and speeds up release cycles.
- **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC):** Automating infrastructure provisioning ensures consistency across environments and minimizes configuration drift.
- **Monitoring and Alerting:** Automated systems track performance metrics and trigger alerts for anomalies, enabling faster incident resolution.

However, automation is not a magic solution. Its effectiveness depends on the quality of the processes it supports.

## When to Automate?

- **Resource Constraints:**
   - Repetitive tasks
   - Lack of familiarity and training
   - Technical complexity

- **Change Management:**
   - Frequent changes spanning multiple roles and departments
   - Complexity in network topology requiring specialized skill-set
   - Manual tools used across the organization

- **Compliance Requirements:**
   - Need processes to address compliance requirements
   - Lack of expertise
   - Expensive to do

- **Monitoring Needs:**
   - Complex setup
   - Keep track of service availability, performance, uptime, reporting
   - Reduce expensive skill set

## Why Automate Only Healthy Processes?

Automation is a force multiplier—it amplifies the characteristics of the underlying process. Automating an efficient, well-designed process leads to greater efficiency and reliability. Conversely, automating a broken or inefficient process can:

- **Accelerate Errors:** Automation can execute flawed processes faster, spreading errors more quickly.  
  - **Example:** Imagine a system where incorrect customer addresses are entered manually. Automating this without fixing the data validation issue will result in sending incorrect addresses faster to multiple systems.

- **Increase Costs:** Time and resources spent automating inefficient workflows result in diminished ROI.  
  - **Example:** Automating a process that requires excessive approvals or redundant data entries will still be slow and costly even if automated.

- **Erode Trust:** Persistent errors from automated systems can undermine confidence in DevOps tools and practices.  
  - **Example:** If automated testing tools constantly flag false positives because the test scripts are poorly written, the team may ignore critical failures.

To avoid these pitfalls, organizations must prioritize fixing processes before introducing automation.

## Steps to Identify and Fix Broken Processes

1. **Conduct Value Stream Mapping:**  
   - **Example:** A development team maps out their CI/CD pipeline and finds that manual quality assurance (QA) steps delay deployments by two days. They streamline QA by introducing automated testing.
   - Map out the end-to-end process to identify bottlenecks, redundancies, and inefficiencies.
   - Understand where delays, errors, or unnecessary complexities exist.

2. **Engage in Root Cause Analysis:**  
   - **Example:** A customer support process experiences frequent delays. Using the 5 Whys technique, the team discovers that delays occur because tickets are routed to the wrong team due to unclear categorization rules.
   - Use techniques like the 5 Whys or Fishbone Diagrams to uncover the root causes of inefficiencies or failures.

3. **Simplify and Standardize:**  
   - **Example:** A company finds their approval process for software changes varies between teams. They standardize it to a single workflow, reducing confusion and delays.
   - Eliminate unnecessary steps and standardize workflows to reduce variability and complexity.
   - Align processes with business objectives and best practices.

4. **Test the Refined Process:**  
   - **Example:** After redesigning their incident resolution process, a team tests it during a simulated outage. They confirm it reduces resolution time by 30% before automating.
   - Run the process manually to ensure it is logical, efficient, and error-free before automation.

## Automating a Healthy Process

Once the process is reliable, efficient, and free of defects, automation can maximize its potential. Here are some best practices:

1. **Select the Right Tools:**  
   - **Example:** A team uses Terraform for IaC, ensuring consistent server setups across development, staging, and production environments.
   - Choose automation tools that align with your use case, such as Azure DevOps, GitLab, GitHub for CI/CD, Terraform for IaC, or Selenium for automated testing.

2. **Implement Incrementally:**  
   - **Example:** A company starts by automating its unit testing before expanding to integration and system testing.
   - Start with automating smaller, well-understood parts of the process before scaling up.

3. **Monitor Automation Performance:**  
   - **Example:** A team monitors their CI/CD pipeline and notices build times increasing. They identify and fix a poorly optimized testing script.
   - Continuously monitor automated workflows to identify areas for further optimization or refinement.

4. **Document and Train:**  
   - **Example:** After automating infrastructure provisioning, a team creates a detailed guide and holds workshops to ensure all developers can use the new system effectively.
   - Ensure teams understand the automated system through clear documentation and training, fostering trust and usability.

## Key Benefits of Fixing Before Automating

1. **Consistency:** Ensures that the automated process consistently delivers the desired outcomes.  
   - **Example:** Automating a refined QA process guarantees tests always run the same way across environments.

2. **Efficiency:** Reduces wasted time and resources by streamlining workflows before automation.  
   - **Example:** Automating a simplified incident management process reduces average resolution times by 50%.

3. **Reliability:** Builds confidence in automation as errors and inefficiencies are addressed beforehand.  
   - **Example:** Automating a stable CI/CD pipeline results in predictable and reliable deployments.

4. **Scalability:** Enables automation to scale effectively, supporting growing business needs without compounding issues.  
   - **Example:** Automating a streamlined onboarding process allows a company to onboard hundreds of users with minimal effort.

## Conclusion

Automation is a powerful enabler in the DevOps toolkit, but its success depends on the quality of the underlying processes. By adhering to the principle of "fix before you automate," organizations can harness automation to drive genuine transformation. This approach not only prevents the magnification of inefficiencies but also ensures that automation delivers on its promise of speed, reliability, and efficiency. Remember: a strong foundation is key to building a robust automated system.
