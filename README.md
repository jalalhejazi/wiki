## 🚧 Lack of Alignment Impedes Progress 🚧

Organizations often face significant challenges when teams and stakeholders pursue differing goals without proper alignment. This lack of synchronization can severely hinder progress. Here's an overview of the key issues and solutions:  

### ⚔️ Conflicting Objectives  
- **Development Teams**: Focus on speed and innovation.  
- **Operations Teams**: Prioritize stability and risk minimization.  
- **Business Units**: Target broader organizational goals.  

When these objectives are not aligned, teams may work at cross-purposes, creating friction and inefficiencies.
